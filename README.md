# Calculator

This is a fun project I did in my spare time. The challenge was to create an ultra beautiful, yet logical, UI, while learning SASS/SCSS. The interface features 2 calculators born from different eras: The *Modern* (left) calculator appears as an iPhone app with a present-day aesthetic. The *Old School* (right) calculator replicates the now-obsolete, physical machine. This app is an homage to the progression of UI's over the years using calculators as a case study.

### Desciption
Although both **Modern** and **Old School** essentially have the same purpose, they have distinct logic. For example, *Modern* allows you to type in multiple math expressions before pressing `enter`, and then returns a result based on order of operations. *Old School* requires each expression to be computed one-by-one. This means *Modern* allows users to backspace characters, while *Old School* only allows a full clear. Lastly, but not limited to, for *Old School*, if a user clicks the **=** button consecutively, the value displayed is a result of repeating the last expression. *Modern* does not have this capability.

##### Other things
* The time displayed in the iPhone reflects the actual time.
* When pressing buttons in **Modern**, the display will show a color-coded record of what was pressed. Operators and numbers have different colors.
* For **Old School**, the orange circle in the slider changes position when clicked.
* Each button in **Old School** changes position when clicked to simulate the lowering of physical buttons on an old calculator.
